# The-Nostalgia-Project-src
This is a collection of decompiled classes for a mod called "The Nostalgia project", (also known as NBX, which stands for NoBiomesX). It brings stuff from the old days of Minecraft Java Edition back into the game. This version of the mod is made for Release 1.0.0. And just to let you know, I didn't make this mod. I didn't work on it in any way. It is made by a user in www.minecraftforum.net called "InsanityBringer", so all of the credit goes to him. I'm just an autistic, Puerto Rican, visual artist who wants to preserve this mod by decompiling it into source code so any Java developer or Minecraft modder can take a look at how this ancient mod works; and maybe attempt to port this thing to something like Minecraft Forge or Fabric, or add the world generator as a world type for a world generation mod for Minecraft Java Edition, it's your choice.
